## Features
- **Infinite Scene Rendering**:
  - A seamless, endless environment with controllable camera movement.
  - Smooth transitions and immersive visuals that simulate an infinite world.

- **Core Graphics Techniques**:
  - **Geometry Rendering**: Efficient rendering of 3D objects.
  - **Texture Mapping**: Realistic surface detailing.
  - **Lighting and Shadows**: Dynamic light sources with accurate shadows.
  - **Animation**: Real-time animations for interactive scenes.

- **User Interaction**:
  - Fully controllable camera with keyboard and mouse support.
  - Move forward, backward, and rotate the view to explore the scene.

- **Advanced Graphics Features** (one implemented from the following):
  - **Deferred Shading**
  - **Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion**
  - **Environment Lighting**
  - **Real-Time Global Illumination (e.g., Voxel Cone Tracing)**
  - **Instancing**
  - **Physics-Based Animation** (e.g., particle systems)
  - **Support for Multi-Platform Graphics** (Android/iOS, WebGL, AR/VR)

## Setup and Compilation
1. **Dependencies**:
   - OpenGL 3.3 or higher.
   - A modern GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX series) for optimal performance.
   - C++11 or higher for the application code.

2. **Compilation**:
   - Use a modern compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC) with support for C++11 or higher.
   - Example CMake setup for building the project:
     ```bash
     mkdir build && cd build
     cmake ..
     make
     ```
   - Ensure appropriate OpenGL libraries are linked during compilation.

3. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the generated binary.
   - Use keyboard and mouse controls to interact with the scene.
